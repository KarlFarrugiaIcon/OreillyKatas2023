* Winning Submission Contents

- Prelude (Introduction): Described a background of the problem, the use case, and the end goal of the solution.
- Non-functional Requirements: The team performed an analysis of business requirements (listed down requirement by requirement, and their observations), NFR for each one, and then in the main section just submitted a list of NFRs encompassing all of them. The team did some additional research on the background of the business entities involved, to finetune the NFRs for their needs (e.g. the business case concerned non-profit organisations, so it made sense to focus on feasibility all throughout the system).
- Overall Platform Context: Diagram showing the solution components and personas - short description of what each component does, and what each persona wants to do with the system. (Very simplified diagram).
- User Experience: Section name a bit misleading, here they submitted linear (happy path) processes of end users going through the process.
- Assumptions: Some general assumptions to take everything into context, and give more sense to the narrative.
- User Roles: System user roles.
- Identifying Architectural Quanta: Listing all architecture components and supporting services. For each one, they submitted an architecture diagram, depicting essentially from front-end to back, including external sevices, DB, API/Messaging/Communication style, etcetera.
- Overall Architecture: Logical and Physical view of the Entire System. The Physical View shows the whole picture of each component shown in Identifying Architectural Quanta.
- Platform Roadmap: Section detailing an ideal roadmap, with their suggestion top provide an MVP and then ultimately expand the project in the long term.
- Engineering Practices: References to engineering techniques or design patterns they are considering as part of their implementation. Basic descriptions on each one.
- Resources: Links to relevant resources.

* Finalist Submission Contents

* * 2nd Place

- Problem Analysis: Background of the business case, the drivers and goals (why its being done / pain points / opportunities / where they hope to get), list of summarised business requirements
- Solution: 
- - Strategy: General description of the strategy... this is like a one paragraph description of the architecture.
- - Actors, Actions & Significant Scenarios: Users/Actors and their Actions - as well as flowcharts of the most important processes happening.
- - Architectural Analysis: Analysis of NFRs, Architectural Styles and Additional Considerations - chosen architectural design.
- - High-level Architecture: Simple diagram showing different layers of the system and communication lines.
- - Detailed Architecture: Individual component architectural breakdown. Same style as high-level, but broken down per component.
- - User-facing Workflows: FE Mocks.
- - ADRs - ADR for every single component.
- Future Roadmap: Short description of how they want to expand it to meet long-term business requirements.

* * 3rd Place
- Overview: Background on who they are and what they want to get out of the project.
- Kata Program: Generic description of the business case and major painpoints.
- About the team - Small background on the team.
- Captured Requirements: Description of personas, features of the platforms and desired/required characteristics.
- Architectural Characteristics: NFRs of the architecture and why.
- Proposed Solution: Lengthy description into the background of the problem vis a vis their proposed solution helped with high-level arch diagramsm, descriptions of chosen architecture styles, physical architecture diagrams etcetera.
- Reporting & Business Intelligence (BI): Section dedicated to reporting & BI as well as how these will help the business case.
- Deployments: How deployments will be carried out.
- Sequence diagram: Showing interaction between components and actors.
- Processes: General business process flows (happy paths).
- UI Wireframes
- Additional details including nice features, their backlog (breakdown of Milestones (features) into Epics), general running costsm and risks.

* Similarities between Winning and Submission Contents

- Detail in ADRs - supported by the architectura comparison list, and detailed justifications;
- Detail in business requirements (including actors/actions);
- Painted a picture of the context, why the system is needed (pain points) supported by some research on the problem matter / end users.
- High-level and low-level architectural diagrams

* Contrast between Winning/Submission and Runner Up Contents

- Some runner-ups were bloated with content in comparison to the top 3. Others are way too oversimplified. The winners clearly hit the sweet spot.
- The general structure of their document wasn't as straight and to the point as the top 3. They had very good and very detailed specs, but probably require a lot more reading to grasp whats happening.
