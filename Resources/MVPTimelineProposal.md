# MVP Timeline Proposal

The platform roadmap that has been drafted takes into consideration the infancy of the enterprise, and has therefore been designed in such a way that focuses on introducing streams of revenue as soon as possible to cover necessary funding for the undertaking of this project.

## Delivery Timeline Composition

Four named MVPs are being proposed:
*  MVP 1: Road Warrior Soft-Launch - As the namesake implies, this MVP will involve launching the product with just the essential, barebones features, suitable enough to introduce the potential of the product to the market. The majority of requirements specified in the initial spec are covered completely, with other less critical requirements being delivered in part or planned for launch in a future MVP. This MVP will help establish 'Road Warrior' into the travelling organisation app market, and potentially even introduce investment opportunities. The inclusion of lightweight advertisements in the barebones version of the application will also introduce a new and immediate stream of revenue, scaling based on the number of users (as will running costs, as a matter of fact).

*  MVP 2: Shared Dashboards - Introduce features that support collaboration/sharing among authenticated users, expanding the social elements of the application.
