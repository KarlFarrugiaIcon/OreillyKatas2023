# ADR 14: Space-Based Architecture

## Status  
Approved

## Rationale

The system's requirements align with the benefits offered by SBA. We propose implementing SBA to address the following key aspects; scalability, low-latency data access, redundancy and fault tolerance.

## Decision   
we have decided to adopt an Space-Driven Architecture as the foundational approach for handling data intensive events within the Road Warrior system

## Consequences  
Positive:
+ Scalability
+ High Performance
+ Fault Tolerance
+ Real-time Capabilities
+ Modularity

## Consequences  
Negative:
- Complexity
- Cost
- Data consistency challenges
