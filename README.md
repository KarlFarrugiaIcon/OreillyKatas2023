## Prelude

*Described a background of the problem, the use case, and the end goal of the solution.*

## Non-functional Requirements

*The team performed an analysis of business requirements (listed down requirement by requirement, and their observations), NFR for each one, and then in the main section just submitted a list of NFRs encompassing all of them. The team did some additional research on the background of the business entities involved, to finetune the NFRs for their needs (e.g. the business case concerned non-profit organisations, so it made sense to focus on feasibility all throughout the system).*

## Overall Platform Context

*Diagram showing the solution components and personas - short description of what each component does, and what each persona wants to do with the system. (Very simplified diagram).*

## User Experience

*Section name a bit misleading, here they submitted linear (happy path) processes of end users going through the process.* 

## Assumptions

*Some general assumptions to take everything into context, and give more sense to the narrative.* 

## User Roles

*System user roles.* 

## Identifying Architectural Quanta

*Listing all architecture components and supporting services. For each one, they submitted an architecture diagram, depicting essentially from front-end to back, including external sevices, DB, API/Messaging/Communication style, etcetera.* 

## Overall Architecture

*Logical and Physical view of the Entire System. The Physical View shows the whole picture of each component shown in Identifying Architectural Quanta.* 

## Platform Roadmap

*Section detailing an ideal roadmap, with their suggestion top provide an MVP and then ultimately expand the project in the long term.* 

## Engineering Practices

*References to engineering techniques or design patterns they are considering as part of their implementation. Basic descriptions on each one.* 

## ADRS

*ADRs*

## Resources

*Links to relevant resources.* 

### Our 3rd party integrations

*how/what do they support (this will dictate potentially some of our decisions re. the 5 minute)*
